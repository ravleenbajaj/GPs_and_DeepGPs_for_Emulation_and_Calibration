This repository is under construction and will contain all code files for my Master's research project. For now, it only contains a simulated example.

# Modularised Bayesian Calibration with Gaussian Process Emulator

This repository contains a modular implementation of a **Bayesian calibration framework** using a **Gaussian Process (GP) emulator** and **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)** sampling.  
The goal is to calibrate uncertain model parameters against observed data while efficiently emulating complex computer model outputs.

## Overview

This repository contains implementation a **modular GP–MCMC calibration pipeline**, structured to separate the key components of calibration.
We have also worked on a **full GP–MCMC calibration pipeline** which was computationally expensive (code available).

1. **Data Preprocessing** — Standardizes and scales the inputs/outputs for the GP emulator.  
2. **GP Emulator Construction** — Builds a Gaussian Process model of the simulator response.  
3. **Calibration via MCMC** — Samples from the posterior distribution of model parameters given data.  
4. **Posterior Analysis & Prediction** — Uses posterior draws to generate calibrated model predictions and uncertainty estimates.

The modular structure makes it easy to replace, extend, or independently test each step of the calibration workflow.

## Theoretical Background

The Bayesian calibration approach follows the standard model:

\[
y = \eta(x, \theta) + \delta(x) + \epsilon
\]

where:
- \( y \) = observed data  
- \( \eta(x, \theta) \) = computer model output (emulated via a GP)  
- \( \delta(x) \) = model discrepancy term  
- \( \epsilon \) = observation noise  

Through calibration we want to infer the posterior distribution and uncertainty of the unknown parameters \( \theta \) using Metropolis Hastings MCMC sampling.
